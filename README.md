# Database_project_Pokemon
This project was carried out by Francesco Malferrari (me), Lucrezia Sitta and Lorenzo Rossi (https://github.com/SnowyCoder) for the Unimore "Databases" course.

The result is a Python program capable of managing a Pok√©mon-themed database (a kind of wiki).

The correct use of the application is described in the two READMEs in the "Codes" and "Program" directories.

If you want to read the entire report, from the idea to its final realization, I invite you to read the document "Relazione Progetto Base di Dati Gruppo 22.pdf".

The vote for the project was 30L.
